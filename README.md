In the economic sector of a country, Agriculture plays the most important role.Here we analyse the crop production in the country from 2000 to 2013,to draw few meaning insights such as affect of the National policy for farmers (2007) on the production of the crops in India. The National Policy for farmers (NPF-2007) introduced in 2007 by government of India focus on supplying good quality seeds, disease-free planting material, issuing soil health passbooks to the farmers. We compared and analysed the area of cultivation and production of crop before and after introducing NPF-2007. This project also consists of   Graphical user interface for the Exploratory Data analysis and Data visualisation ,which is dynamic in nature(User can upload data set of his own choice)
